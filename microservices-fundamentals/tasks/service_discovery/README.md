## What to do

In this task, it is needed to change the configuration to use the existing **Service Registry** tool.
Sample implementation: [Eureka Example](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/cloud-gateway-eureka)

## Sub-task 1: Service Registry

1) Update infrastructure of configuration to make sure that **Service Registry** is launched along with existing services.
2) Update clients using Eureka so that they will be called by service name instead of ip:port.
3) Implement Client-Side Balancing.

## Sub-task 2: API Gateway

1) Use API Gateway implementation - Spring Cloud Gateway.
2) Update infrastructure configuration to make sure that API Gateway is launched, exposed and there is a single-entry point in application.
3) Make sure that all services receive traffic from external clients through the API Gateway.
4) Properly handle errors (e.g., if service is not found or route doesn't exist).

## Sub-task 3: Service Configuration (Optional)

1) Create Git repository for storing all needed configuration at one place.
2) Create a service which will play the role of Service Configuration for other services.
3) Update infrastructure configuration by changing one (or more) services so to be able to communicate with Service Configuration.
4) Make sure that all service config clients receive configuration from Service Config.
5) Update service config client to be able to refresh configuration in case it was changed.

**Note.** In case there are issues with running all services on your local machine, for example, not enough CPU range or RAM, here are the following options:

 - use [docker limits](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/)
 - use any cloud free tier system if it’s possible
 - use [EPAM Cloud](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMCITFAQ/Personal+Projects)
