# GenAI Foundations for Java Developers - A Practical Part

This is practical tasks for Epam [GenAI Foundations for Java Developers course](https://learn.epam.com).

## üå± Program Description
This GenAI program is designed for beginners and focuses on practical experience developing generative applications utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Participants will learn modern approaches to developing generative applications using various tools and SDKs.
The program allows:  
‚Ä¢	Achieve basic knowledge needed for creating Generative AI applications.   
‚Ä¢	Gain practical experience interacting with LLM using different SDKs.  
‚Ä¢	Create a simple application that allows querying LLM based on external documents.


**What You Need to Start**
- Access to the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) **OR** [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
- A Github Account to [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/epam-net-cc/GenAIFoundationsForNetDevelopers/fork) to your own GitHub account

We have created a **[Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md)** lesson to help you with setting up your developement environment.
