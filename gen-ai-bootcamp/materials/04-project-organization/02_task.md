# Code Organization Approaches

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Understand how code can be organized for applications using Semantic Kernel
- Learn different types of SK plugins
- Implement code that uses different types of SK plugins

## ðŸ“‘ Task

### Open "Lab4" Project
For this task and for each subsequent task, use the results from the previous task as a basis for new changes.

#### Use the version of Semantic Kernel starting from 1.2 or higher
Semantic Kernel as everything connected with AI rapidly evolves.
It is important to use the latest version of the library to get experience and understand of latest tools.

### Call function from custom plugin:
Review the custom plugin - AgeCalculatorPlugin code from the  [plugin](https://git.epam.com/epm-cdp/global-java-foundation-program/java-courses/-/tree/main/gen-ai-bootcamp/tasks/lab4/gen_ai_training/src/main/java/com/epam/training/gen/ai/semantic/plugin) folder.
Or use [this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/using-semantic-kernel-to-create-a-time-plugin-with-java/) is an example

Your task is to use the AgeCalculatorPlugin into the existing system. 
Once integrated, the system should be able to calculate ages based on user-provided birthdays.
Upon successful integration, the system should accurately calculate and display ages based on user-provided birthdays, enhancing its functionality.

### Wikipedia Search URL Integration
Your task is to integrate the `getWikipediaSearchUrl` function from the provided
SearchUrlPlugin into the existing system. This function takes a search query
as input and generates a URL for searching that query on Wikipedia. The
integration should seamlessly incorporate this functionality into the system,
allowing users to generate Wikipedia search URLs easily.

Call the plugin with the next parameters:
```csharp
    { "query", "Europe" },
```
Output chat history and validate that it contains the uri for "Europe" page on Wikipedia.

### Implement custom plugin
Your task is to implement the BingSearchUrl function within the existing system.
This function should generate a URL for Bing search queries based on the provided
search query input. The integration should seamlessly incorporate this functionality
into the system, allowing users to generate Bing search URLs effortlessly.

Call the plugin with the next parameters:
```csharp
    { "query", "cute kittens on vespas" },
```
Output chat history and validate that it contains the uri to review cute kittens on vespas.
