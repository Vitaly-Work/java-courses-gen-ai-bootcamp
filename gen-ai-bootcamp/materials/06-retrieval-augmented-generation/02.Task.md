# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Understand what is Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Learn how to use embeddings with RAG
- Implement RAG application that uses pdf document as a knowledge source

## ðŸ“‘ Lesson

You need to implement a simple application that uses RAG approach to generate text based on the knowledge source. We do not impose any restrictions on the approach to application development. You can write a console or web application, you can use any database, etc...

We only have two requirements for the application.:
- Application should have ability to upload new documents and use it as a knowledge source.
- Application should have ability to generate text based on the knowledge sources.
