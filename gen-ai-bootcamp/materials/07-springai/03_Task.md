## ðŸ“‘ Task

### Open "Lab7" Project

Open the "Lab7" project located in the [`tasks/lab7` folder](https://git.epam.com/epm-cdp/global-java-foundation-program/java-courses/-/tree/main/gen-ai-bootcamp/tasks/lab7) of your course materials. This project contains the initial setup required for this task, including the necessary project configuration and dependencies.

### Part 1: Chat Service with System Prompt

In the first part of the task, we will create a Chat Service that includes a system prompt. Users will be able to send
requests to the Chat Service and ask questions. The responses from the Chat Service will be influenced by the system
prompt.

### Part 2: Vector Database Support and Document Reader Service

In the second part of the task, we will extend the functionality of our application by adding vector database support.
We will also introduce a Document Reader Service that can read PDF documents and answer questions about the content of
these documents from the Chat Service.

### Closing
