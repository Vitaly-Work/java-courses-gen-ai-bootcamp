# üçÉ Introduction to Spring AI

Spring AI is a relatively new Spring Project with current version 0.8.1. It is a collection of libraries and tools that
help you integrate AI features within Spring Boot applications.

Spring AI offers a comprehensive suite of features for Java developers integrating AI into their applications. It
supports major AI models and vector database providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. The framework provides
a unified API for different AI services, like chat and image generation, and allows for easy integration with vector
databases. It also maps AI outputs to Java objects and includes tools for data engineering, making it easier to
implement features like Q&A or chat functionalities within applications.

It was inspired by Python Projects (LangChain and LlamaIndex) and aims to provide a similar experience in the Java
ecosystem. Spring AI is designed to be lightweight and easy to use with relatively limited set of features as of this
moment, but it is expected to grow in the future.

## üìö Learning Objectives

- **Spring AI Overview**: Understand the foundation of Spring AI, including support for AI and vector databases, a portable API, and mapping AI model outputs to Java objects.

- **Getting Started**: Kickstart your journey with Spring AI, from project setup using Spring CLI and Spring Initializr, to managing dependencies and integrating AI functionalities.

This workshop promises a hands-on learning experience, guiding you through the end-to-end process of building AI-enabled applications with Spring AI.
