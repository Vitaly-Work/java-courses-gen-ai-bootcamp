# Databricks Community Edition
Unlike the Databricks Free Trial, Community Edition doesnâ€™t require that you have your own cloud account or supply cloud compute or storage resources.

However, several features available in the Databricks Platform Free Trial, such as the [REST API](https://docs.databricks.com/api/azure/workspace/introduction), are not available in Databricks Community Edition. For details, see [Databricks Community Edition FAQ](https://databricks.com/product/faq/community-edition).
